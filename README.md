## Algorithms
Implementations of algorithms used for competitive programming, with a focus placed on readability, usability, conciseness, and performance (when important).

Common macros/typedef used:
```
#define all(v) v.begin(), v.end()
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
```

Repo automatically generated from https://gist.github.com/Chillee. Some algorithms will have comments on the gists.
